You are an expert full-stack developer. Build me a personal portfolio website with the following requirements:

ðŸŽ¨ Frontend:
- Use React with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Public pages: 
  - Home: short intro, profile photo, social links.
  - Certificates: display uploaded certificates (PDFs or images).
  - Projects: grid layout showing project title, description, tech stack, GitHub/demo links, and screenshots.
  - Skills: show skills as badges or progress bars.
  - Contact: simple form with name, email, and message (store in DB).
- Mobile-responsive design, clean and modern (minimalistic, card-based UI).
- Add a "Download CV" button.

ðŸ”’ Admin Backend:
- Use Node.js + Express (or FastAPI if easier).
- Authentication: only I can log in (username + password with JWT auth).
- Admin Dashboard (separate route `/admin`):
  - Upload certificates (image/PDF).
  - Add/edit/delete projects (title, description, tech stack, GitHub/demo links, screenshots).
  - Add/edit/delete skills.
  - View contact form submissions.
- When I upload or edit content, it should instantly update the frontend.

ðŸ’¾ Database:
- Use MongoDB.
- Collections: users, projects, certificates, skills, messages.

ðŸš€ Deployment:
- Deploy frontend on Vercel.
- Deploy backend + DB on Render/Railway (or AWS if easier).
- Connect frontend and backend via REST API.

âœ¨ Notes:
- Secure login (hash passwords).
- Clean code with comments.
- CRUD APIs for certificates, projects, skills, and messages.
